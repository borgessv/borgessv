- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vitor and I am currently working on scientific machine earning methods to enhance computational performance of flexible aircraft simulations.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in geometrically nonlinear structures, aerodynamics, aeroelasticity and scientific machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning low- and medium-fidelity unsteady aerodynamic models, such as unsteady lifting-line theory and unsteady vortex-lattice method.
